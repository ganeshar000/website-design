<!--INTRODUCTION-->
<h4><i> Are you the type of person that likes to go all out? </i></h4>
<p><b>Make an Earthship Bioshelter!</b> Introduced in the 1970s, the Earthship Bioshelter concept uses a variety of materials such as waste tires, glass bottles and cans to minimally impact the environment. They can be found all over the world and in the U.S. Often off the grid, this option is the most drastic of any since it requires the most innovation, planning and dedication. It also combines many of the other options we have listed on our site for you to explore. However, if done properly, earthship Bioshelters can be aesthetically pleasing and very eco-friendly. They usually rise out of the earth and can be made to make its own water, heating and cooling systems. Exterior walls are often constructed of earth filled tires to regulate temperature while interior walls constructed of honeycomb of empty cans/glass bottles to be artistically beautiful.

<!--PROS/CONS-->
<div class="w3-row w3-container">
<!-- Start Row -->
	<div class="w3-half" style="">
  	<h3 class="w3-center"><u><i>Pros</i></u></h3>
 	<ul>   
	<li><h4><i>Environmentally conscious</h4></i>

<p>You will use <b>public utilities and fossil fuels less</b> as well as be <b>energy efficient</b> through solar/geothermal heating and cooling, natural light, and recycling. You will be mostly <b>self sustainable</b> since you can grow food, use/reuse water, and try rain/greywater harvesting. You may even be <b>paid to take away materials</b> that might otherwise be burned illegally!

	<li><h4><i>Innovation</i></h4>
<p >You can be creative and make this Earthship Bioshelter to <b>fit your needs</b> and wants for a dwelling.</dd>

  	<h3 class="w3-center "><u><i>Cons</i></u></h3>
  	<ul>
 	 
  	<li><h4><i>May encounter problems</h4></i>
  <p >There types of <b>dwellings don’t work well in all climates</b>. Roofs can leak and there are sometimes humidity issues. In general, they might not work as intended, especially if not designed well. You may also need to use food outside of what you produce in your bioshelter. <b>Bugs</b> can be another problem.
 	 
  	<li><h4><i>Health related concerns</h4></i>
  <p> ½ of <b>design is often concrete</b> (which isn’t natural) and this negatively affects breathing if it removes oxygen from air. The gas released by tires is not good for you, and mold can grow easily in some models.
 	 
  	<li><h4><i>Time & Money</h4></i>
<p> It takes a <b>lot of time to collect</b> all recycled materials, it’s not very cheap to make or fix, and it can take 3 or more years to sell. <b>Insurance</b> is also sometimes hard to get.</dd>

<!-- PLANNING -->
<div class="w3-container" id="planning">
<h3 class="w3-center"><u><i>Planning</i></u></h3>
<div class="w3-container" style=" margin-right:1%;">
<!-- start table -->
<ul>
<li>Get a <b>passive solar designer or architect</b> to help you make the best model for your region: This will ensure that you utilize all the natural phenomenons around you while minimizing cost and effort.
<li>Catch water from a local environment: While you can do gray water harvesting, you can’t actually drink that water. You’ll need to see what other options are available near you for drinking water. To learn more about <b>grey water harvesting</b> and what it is used for, click <a href="http://environment-ecology.com/environment-and-architecture/375-what-is-earthship.html">here</a>.
<li>Make sure your home has the correct orientation and doesn’t have certain features: This could be things such as sloping window walls. To find out more or to understand why, click <a href="https://archinia.com/earthships/solving-earthship-enigma">here</a>.
<li>Use <b>wind energy</b>: It can be an electricity source.
<li>Use <b>solar energy</b>: It can be a source for heating.

<!-- COST-->
<div class="w3-container" style=" margin-left:1%;" id="cost">
<h3 class="w3-center" ><u><i>Cost</i></u></h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the easiest ways to make an Earthship Bioshelter is to have the Earthship Biotecture company build it for you. This would cost $225/square foot, and sustainable construction might only take a few months. Visit their site <a href="https://www.earthshipglobal.com">here</a>.
<li> You can also build one on your own,* though it could take up to 2 years. But, don’t be discouraged! A couple in Ontario only paid $55,000 for 2,900 square feet since they did a majority of the work themselves, and they have no electric bills! Get inspired by reading about it <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/the-55k-2900-square-foot-eco-friendly-home-with-no-electricity-bills/article4602606/">here</a>.
<li>*(Please note that if you are not particularly healthy or strong, this process may be too strenuous for you to do on your own).
