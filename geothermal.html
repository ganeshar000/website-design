  <h4><i> Savings and Sustainability </i></h4>
	<p>You can find both in a <b>Geothermal Heating and Cooling</b> system for your home. It is the most environment friendly heating and cooling system available and has a <b>400% efficiency rating.</b> It <b>lasts twice as long</b> as a traditional heating and cooling system, is much quieter and its <b>low Carbon Monoxide emissions </b>make it safer for you and your family. <a href="https://www.waterfurnace.com/residential/about-geothermal/featured-installations">Check out </a>the stories of the thousands of American homeowners who have switched to cleaner and greener lives with geothermal.

 	<p>It works by using renewable <b>energy stored in the ground</b> as a heat source during winters and as a depository during summers. A series of pipes, known as an earth loop, is buried under the ground, which carries an <b>eco-friendly solution</b> of alcohol and water, allowing heat to move to and fro from the home. It <b>doesnâ€™t consume any fossil fuels</b>, does not have a huge outdoor unit, and is <b>durable and dependable</b>. <a href="https://www.waterfurnace.com/residential/about-geothermal/">Learn more...</a>

	<h3 class="w3-center"><i><u> Costs and Installation </u></i></h3>
	<p>The first step when thinking about installing this system is to <b>contact a professional.</b> It is important that the system is installed according to government regulations and works efficiently so you can reap the most benefits. <a href="https://www.waterfurnace.com/residential/dealer-locator/">Check out </a> this website to find a licensed dealer in your area to get you started.
	<p>For a 2500 sq.ft. home, the cost can easily go up to $20,000 for a 60,000 thermal unit load. Although it has a pretty high cost, the <b>utility bills go down by 40%-60%.</b> Not only that, you also are eligible for <b> 30% or more <a href="https://www.dsireusa.org/">tax returns </a></b> from the government. The overall savings and returns on a geothermal installation truly outweigh its initial installation cost, and to see the cost benefits for your home, check out this <a href="https://www.climatemaster.com/residential/geothermal-savings-calculator/sc01.php">savings calculator.</a>

	<h3 class="w3-center"><i><u> Some things to keep in mind </u></i></h3>
	<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li>It is a site dependant installation, and to know if your house is qualified you will have to talk to an expert.<br>
	<li>The payback from the system may take anywhere from 2-10 years, so make sure you are on top of your finances when installing the system.<br>
	<li>The installation often disturbs surrounding landscapes, but only spans over 2-3 days. <br>
	<li>The EPA encourages installation of these systems, especially in highly favourable areas like the West Coast area. Check out the map <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/gis/geothermal.html">here.</a> <br>
