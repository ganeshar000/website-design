 	<h2><i> How does it work? </i></h2>
 	<p>It works by using renewable <b>energy stored in the ground</b> as a heat source during winters and as a depository during summers. A series of pipes, known as an earth loop, is buried under the ground, which carries an <b>eco-friendly solution</b> of alcohol and water, allowing heat to move to and fro from the home. It <b>doesnâ€™t consume any fossil fuels</b>, does not have a huge outdoor unit, and is <b>durable and dependable</b>. <a href="https://www.waterfurnace.com/residential/about-geothermal/">Learn more...</a>

	<h3><i> Costs and Installation </i></h3>
	<p>The first step when thinking about installing this system is to <b>contact a professional.</b> It is important that the system is installed according to government regulations and works efficiently so you can reap the most benefits. <a href="https://www.waterfurnace.com/residential/dealer-locator/">Check out </a> this website to find a licensed dealer in your area to get you started.
	<p>For a 2500 sq.ft. home, the cost can easily go up to $20,000 for a 60,000 thermal unit load. Although it has a pretty high cost, the <b>utility bills go down by 40%-60%.</b> Not only that, you also are eligible for <b> 30% or more <a href="https://www.dsireusa.org/">tax returns </a></b> from the government. The overall savings and returns on a geothermal installation truly outweigh its initial installation cost, and to see the cost benefits for your home, check out this <a href="https://www.climatemaster.com/residential/geothermal-savings-calculator/sc01.php">savings calculator.</a>

	<br>
   
	<h3><i> Some things to keep in mind: </i></h3>
	<ul>
    <li>It is a site dependant installation, and to know if your house is qualified you will have to talk to an expert.<br>
    <li>The payback from the system may take anywhere from 2-10 years, so make sure you are on top of your finances when installing the system.<br>
    <li>The installation often disturbs surrounding landscapes, but only spans over 2-3 days. <br>
    <li>The EPA encourages installation of these systems, especially in highly favourable areas like the West Coast area. Check out the map <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/gis/geothermal.html">here.</a> <br>
